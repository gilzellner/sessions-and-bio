## Short Abstract (299 chars)

We spend a LOT of time optimizing our pipelines, work environments etc. Why not use the same skills to make our home life better ? 
Inspired by the John Willis Post of the same name: https://devops.com/homeops-learning-devops-home/ But takes a slightly different approach

## Long Abstract

This is a head fake lecture on how to get into an “optimize everything” mentality. If you say that out loud right away, people will just nod and carry on sitting in traffic instead of optimising around it. They will still go to the grocery store instead of ordering groceries online, and they will still waste their time on unimportant things. You need to talk about a story to get your head in the right place.
