## Short Abstract (299 chars)

I shall draw comparisons between caring for a newborn baby and a production system, including analytics, hacks etc. The gist is the I reframed the care for a child in a way I am able to deal with it (production engineering) and we should all reframe things as a technique to deal with problems.


## Long Abstract

When my wife told me she was pregnant I was scared of the new responsibility, and was certain I would screw it up. This is how I dealt with it by reframing the problem. I shall draw comparisons between caring for a baby and a production system, including analytics, hacks etc.
