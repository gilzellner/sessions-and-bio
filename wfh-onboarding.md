## Short Abstract (299 chars)

I started at Wix in February. Everyone was working from home, and it is HARD to start a new job that way.
Here are a few things I did that you can do in any job, that will improve your onboarding

## Long Abstract

I go over several tips and tricks to ease your onboarding..

- reOrganize the team knowledgebase.
- Pair programming for routine tasks.
- Work on the skaffolding (build issues, dev environments, etc)
- Async questions == slack based documentation
- insist on joining discussions
- take your time
- Humble questions on "why things are this way"
- You can do all of these from the office as well.

Headfake:
These are things you can and should do ALWAYS when joining a new team, job, etc.
