# What TCP\IP can teach us about working with unreliable people

## Abstract:

TCP is a miraculous thing. It uses a very unreliable IP protocol, and builds this amazing reliability in a world of unreliable things.
We take TCP\IP for granted, because we've had it for so many years, but we can learn a lot from the way it can create order in a world of chaos.
We can then take those lessons and apply them to working with humans!
