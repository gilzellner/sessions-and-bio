## Short Abstract (299 chars)

having done both Dev and Ops, I feel there is some truth, but several lies as well as to how having sysadmin experience affects devs, and how dev experience affects sysadmins. The title is a play on words from JRR Tolkeinâ€™s Hobbit (There and back again), and will be told as a story


## Long Abstract

The endgame of this talk is that diverse roles make you better at many things. Not only why this is good, but how to do it as well. From the side of both a person who did it for himself out of pure interest and/or circumstance, and of a person who is now trying to find such people to join his team.
