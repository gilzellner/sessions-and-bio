## Short Abstract (299 chars)

What does it mean to manage a field without a team?
are you even a manager? or maybe a fixer?
I am a Michael Clayton of things at HourOne.ai, and I have learned a lot about what I can or can't do in this situation.
I also believe that some conclusions here apply to the industry at large.

# How is your talk relevant to our audience?

Leadership is a lot about resource management, 
this would provide a thought framework to better discuss build vs buy,
developer internally vs outsource, and many other deliberations.
