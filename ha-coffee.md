## Short Abstract (299 chars)

working from home means we need to self manage a lot of things, from being our own IT people, to getting our own food, to making our own coffee. Coffee is critical infra, so lets treat it as such, with a coffee service architecture. But it is not highly available. How do we make it highly available?

## Notes to reviewers

This is a head fake lecture on High availability which turns into a take on refactoring, architecture and interfaces. We will have some code, jokes, etc. Here is the github link (https://github.com/gilzellner/HA-Coffee), once I complete writing the code for this, it will be here. There will also be a blog post on this. Slides are ready and I can show them if you need to better evaluate this talk.
